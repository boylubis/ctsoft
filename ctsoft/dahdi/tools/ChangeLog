	  will be "probed" to determine if it's an FXO or FXS channel and
	  that can result in the output of proc changing. When the size of
	  proc changes, the script can get confused about where the
	  beginning of the next line is. This patch reads in the proc file
	  completely into memory first, and then starts processing each of

	* dahdi_scan.c, /: Fixed up the loss of crc4-multiframe alignment
	  logic Loss of crc4-multiframe alignment on an E1 link is not a
	  condition which brings the span down. The span will continue to
	  run as long as it can maintain double frame alignment. Because of
	  this, we cannot place the LMFA alarm in the usual spaninfo.alarms
	  member, due to userspace programs using this as a catch-all for a
	  span being up or down. We can detect the alarm by watching the
	  frame error counter (fecount). If it continuously increments, the
	  span is configured for crc4, and the span remains OK (alarms =
	  0), then we are in loss of crc4-multiframe state. In order to
	  test this alarm, you'll need to synthesize a loss of crc4
	  alignment on the span. You can usually do this by configuring the
	  local span to use crc4 and the remote end to not use crc4. I used
	  the Fireberd 6000 in my lab to do this. dahdi-743 & dahdi-420

	* /, xpp/xpp_fxloader: xpp_fxloader: adapt to newer kernels This
	  commit prepares xpp_fxloader to get hotplug envirnment from newer
	  kernel versions: * DEVICE will eventually be replaced with
	  DEVNAME. Accept both (and look at DEVNAME first). * If we get
	  DEVICE, we'll probably get an invalid path based at /proc/bus/usb
	  . Fix it to use /dev/bus/usb . * While we're at it, allow using
	  PRODUCT from the envirnment instead of from the command-line.
	  This should allow fixing udev rules but will also work with
	  existing rules in DAHDI-linux from trunk (for systems where they
	  are valid). Merged revisions 7752 via svnmerge from

	* xpp/xpp_sync, xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Xpp/Xpd.pm: Use the
	  timing_priority attribute, if available, to provide more corrent
	  LED indiction and such. 

	* xpp: use xpd sysfs attr. timing_priority to set NT/TE 

	* dahdi.init, xpp/astribank_is_starting.c (added), 
	  xpp/waitfor_xpds, xpp/astribank_is_starting.8 (added),
	  xpp/twinstar_hook, xpp/xpp_fxloader, xpp/Makefile,
	  xpp/astribank_hook, init.conf.sample: Add optional "hotplug mode"
	  to init scripts The hotplug mode is only used in
	  XPP_HOTPLUG_DAHDI=yes is set in /etc/dahdi/init.conf . If it is
	  set and the system actually has Astribanks, most of the init
	  script will actually be run from the context of a udev event.

	* xpp: Add astribank_is_starting: astribank_is_running is used to
	  tell when we may have an Astribank that is initializing (and may
	  be re-enumerating and thus not listed as a device). It uses a
	  semaphore as we can always write to one and we can't always write
	  to a file. xpp: A man page for astribank_is_starting xpp rev: 7321 

	* dahdi.init: move module loading to a separate function Move the
	  module loading parts of the dahdi init script to a seperate
	  function - load_modules. To be used by a later commit. There is
	  not functional change here (but the diff is confusing). 

	* Add XPP_HOTPLUG_DAHDI mode: cfg initiated mostly from hotplug If
	  XPP_HOTPLUG_DAHDI=yes is set in /etc/dahdi/init.conf (which is
	  not the default), the normal run of the 'start' operation of the
	  dahdi init script will only be responsible for loading modules.
	  The rest will be done (if there are indeed Astribanks on the
	  system) by a second call to the init script once all of them have
	  connected. The astribank_hook has also been mostly rewritten.
	  Most of the functionality of twinstar_hook moved to it. The
	  current twinstar_hook is a simple example script.
	  XPP_HOTPLUG_DAHDI mode assumes that all Astribanks on the system
	  are listed in /etc/dahdi/xpp_order (which can be generated using,
	  e.g. 'dahdi_genconf xpporder') 

	* Fix XPP_HOTPLUG_DAHDI: logic; end of init.d script 'Hotplug mode'
	  was introduced in r7335. * The logic in the script was broken. -
	  Negative logic is not such a grand idea to start with. *
	  Interactive invocation of init.d ends when expected and not
	  sooner. This change makes waitfor_xpds wait longer. Rather than
	  waiting for all the Astribanks to load, it will now wait until
	  the initialization of dahdi from the Astribanks hook script is
	  run. This allows running e.g.: /etc/init.d/dahdi start;
	  /etc/init.d/asterisk start It also means that
	  'astribank_is_starting' is actually used as a semaphore and not
	  only as stamp file. As before, those changes have no effect if
	  hotplug mode is not explicitly enabled (setting
	  'XPP_HOTPLUG_DAHDI=yes' in init.conf). 

	* xpp: make astribank_is_starting build without warnings.
	  autoconfig.h is needed as semtimedop() requires _GNU_SOURCE. xpp
	  rev: 7471

	* xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Config/Params.pm,
	  xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Config/Gen.pm,
	  xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Config/Gen/Chandahdi.pm,

	  xpp/genconf_parameters: CAS DAHD/Asterisk configuration
	  generation support Also support generating (open)R2 config in
	  chan_dahdi.conf, while we're at it. Default configuration remains
	  ISDN as before if no extra settings are given in
	  genconf_parameters. 
	  

	* dahdi-perl: chan_dahdi.conf generator can generate openr2 conf If
	  configured to use R2 ("pri_connection_type R2" in
	  genconf_parameters), the chandahdi generator of dahdi_genconf
	  will now generate configuration for the openr2 support in
	  chan_dahdi. 

	* xpp: Dahdi::Config::Gen.pm: improvements in preperation for
	  T1-CAS: - New channo_range() method which returns range strings
	  for any list of channel numbers (handle sorting, validation,
	  etc.) - Reimplement bchan_range() as a small wrapper around
	  channo_range(). - Another small wrapper is chan_range() that
	  works on channel objects. - Also a parse_chan_range() does the
	  reverse (from range string to a list of channel numbers). This
	  isn't used at the moment. xpp rev: 7306 

	* dahdi-perl: Add basic T1-CAS support for dahdi_genconf - Support
	  added in generators of system.conf and of chan_dahdi.conf . -
	  Some strange asumptions about being FXS/FXO depending on being
	  timing provider/supplier. - New gen_cas() method for Chandahdi
	  and System. - Now gen_digital() is a bit cleaner. - Call
	  gen_cas(), gen_openr2(), gen_digital() according to the
	  'pri_connection_type' config (CAS, R2, PRI/BRI). xpp rev: 7307
	  

	* dahdi_perl: improved config generation for T1 CAS A few extra
	  options for a CAS span signalling. xpp rev: 7343, 7346, 7369 

	* xpp: reduce the clutter of firmware loading Make the new XPP
	  tools much less verbose: * demote messages to be debug * Convert
	  multi-line messages to be single-line messages Making
	  xpp_fxloader run in debug mode can be done by setting DEBUG=yes
	  in /etc/dahdi/init.conf. 

	* dahdi-perl fixes, mostly xpp-specific. * Fix pattern for PCI BRI
	  cards * Fix recognizing xpp devices by @connector in xpp_order *
	  Print more helpful comments in xpp_order * Remove most (if not
	  all) need of /proc/bus/usb * Handle other similar "is_twinstar"
	  errors.

	* dahdi_genconf: xpp_order generator: Extra '#' after connector
	  comment Add an extra '#' right after the connector string to make
	  it simpler to use the connector string from the generated
	  xpp_order. xpp rev: 7292 

	* xpp: make /proc/bus/usb/devices optional Get the information we
	  read from /proc/bus/usb/devices from /sys/bus/usb/devices .
	  Tested on my Debian Unstable with 2.6.30 kernel. The default is
	  still /proc/bus/usb and sysfs is only used if the procfs file is
	  not found. Also fixes a case of using the sysfs attribute busnum,
	  that does not exist in kernel 2.6.9 . Devise the bus number from
	  the name of the node. 

	* dahdi-perl: Avoid '"is_twinstar" on unblessed reference' Dpn't
	  panic if a device is not found in the list of hardware. This is
	  not only indication of a bug, but can also happen if a device
	  appeared after the script was started.

	  issue #14832) Reported by: jlduran Patch by: jldruan

	* Pass correct channel number to DAHDI_GET_PARAMS when passing span
	  numbers to dahdi_scan. When filtering, we weren't taking into

	  dahdi_genconf's 'bri_hardhdlc' parameter changes. Should
	  generally work with no need for manual configuration unless you
	  use a bristuffed driver (zaphfc, qozap). See notes in
	  genconf_parameters.

	* xpp/waitfor_xpds, dahdi.init: dahdi.init: moved test for
	  astribanks into waitfor_xpds If the system starts with an
	  Astribank with no firmware, the firmware loading may take a while
	  and the Astribank only becomes ready some time after the DAHDI
	  init script starts. This means that the test at the beginning of
	  xpp_startup() in dahdi.init fails to find an Astribank, and the
	  init script simply continues ignoring this. This changeset moves
	  the testing inside the script waitfor_xpds. The script now: 1.
	  Tests for an Astribank using dahdi_hardware and exists
	  immediately if none found. 2. A loop (of maximum 10 seconds)
	  waits for the first Astribank to be detected by the driver. 3.
	  Waiting for the initialization of all the Astribanks to complete
	  (The original waitfor_xpds) The support for the old procfs
	  iinterface has been removed, as it has never been used with
	  DAHDI.

	* xpp/Makefile, xpp/astribank_tool.8, xpp/astribank_allow.8

	* xpp/mpp_funcs.c, xpp/astribank_tool.c: astribank_tool: Support
	  'reset' of pre-MPP protocol as fallback As of USB firmware rev.
	  6926, the Astribank control connection protocol has changed in an
	  incompatible manner. If astribank_tool fails to open a device
	  when running a reset command, try to reset the device with the
	  command from the old (pre-MPP) protocol (A single 0x20 byte). No
	  support whatsoever for any other feature of the old protocol.
	  From xpp rev. 7067. (previous commit was xpp rev. 7066).

	* dahdi_cfg.c: when /etc/dahdi/system.conf does not have an echo

	  behavior, so that every channel with a defined signaling mode is
	  updated to have the proper (or no) echo canceller assigned.

	* xpp/dahdi.cgi (added): A CGI script to give some information
	  about Zaptel through the Dahdi perl interface. A simple demo. Not
	  installed automatically.

2008-10-10 18:29 +0000 [r5079-5082]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* Makefile: Fix 'make config' for distros with no chkconfig and no
	  update-rc.d . This would cause the error on 'make config' for
	  "unknown command dahdi", and 'make -n config' would show that it
	  tries to run "dahdi defaults 15 30"

	* dahdi_test.c: revert r5077 as r5078 fixes this better: now we can
	  use 8 entries in a line.

	* dahdi_test.c: make dahdi_test's prints fit in one line. It makes
	  them slightly less "accurate", but we already use it in the
	  verbose messages, and dahdi_test is not really accurate.

2008-10-10 16:15 +0000 [r5072-5077]  Sean Bright <sean.bright@gmail.com>

	* dahdi_test.c: Wrap at 6 instead of 8 so we are sure to fit on an
	  80 column terminal.

	* dahdi.init: Return the appropriate values to indicate if the
	  modules are loaded or not.

	* dahdi.init: Add a status command to the DAHDI init script.
	  (closes issue #13655) Reported by: jcollie Patches:
	  0001-Add-a-trivial-status-command-to-the-init-script.patch
	  uploaded by jcollie (license 412) (Slight modification by me to
	  update the usage text)

2008-10-03 19:37 +0000 [r5044]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Config/GenconfDefaults.pm: When the config
	  file is not found: return "empty" data and don't die. Closes
	  issues #13615 .

2008-10-03 19:03 +0000 [r5038-5042]  Sean Bright <sean.bright@gmail.com>

	* dahdi_test.c: Whitespace and formatting only.

	* dahdi_test.c: The first line was getting wrapped after 7 instead
	  of 8.

	* xpp/genzaptelconf (removed), xpp/genzaptelconf.8 (removed):
	  Remove some leftovers.

	* dahdi_scan.c, doc/dahdi_scan.8: Fix the dahdi_scan manpage
	  (s/dahdi_span/dahdi_scan/) and make dahdi_scan do what it is
	  advertised to do. Namely take span numbers on the command line.
	  (closes issue #13614) Reported by: jfinstrom

2008-09-29 Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* dahdi-tools 2.0.0 released.

2008-09-25 15:47 +0000 [r4984]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* dahdi.init: dahdi_init: Fix a typo in xpp initialization (Stephen
	  Farrell)

2008-09-24 19:54 +0000 [r4977]  Sean Bright <sean.bright@gmail.com>

	* build_tools/menuselect-deps.in, configure, configure.ac,
	  dahdi.xml: Re-enable sethdlc by default in menuselect. Add
	  configure checks to properly discover the linux/hdlc.h
	  dependency.

2008-09-24 17:35 +0000 [r4975]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* dahdi.xml: Disable sethdlc in menuselect by default. This is how
	  it was in Zaptel, and it's causing issues. Ideally, this would
	  eventually be checked in the configure script.

2008-09-23 04:56 +0000 [r4969]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* README: Removing the note about running install_prereq since from
	  the README since that script is not present currently.

2008-09-16 18:26 +0000 [r4913-4915]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* dahdi.init: Remove the extra space printed after each line when a
	  module is loaded.

	* dahdi_cfg.c: Close the /dev/dahdi/channel file handle if we're
	  unable to associate it with a particular channel.

	* dahdi_cfg.c: Provide system error information if open on
	  /dev/dahdi/channel fails.

2008-09-12 18:06 +0000 [r4904]  Sean Bright <sean.bright@gmail.com>

	* Makefile, /, configure, configure.ac, makeopts.in: A few changes:
	  1) Start using menuselect trunk 2) Bring in changes similar to
	  those in asterisk trunk so that 'make menuselect' works as it
	  should from the dahdi-tools directory. 3) Stop looking for
	  curses/ncurses in the top level configure since nothing uses it
	  (except menuselect which will find it on it's own).

2008-09-11 20:52 +0000 [r4894]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* xpp/Makefile, xpp/xpp.rules (removed): Move udev rules xpp.rules
	  from dahdi-tools to dahdi-linux .

2008-09-11 15:45 +0000 [r4891-4893]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* Makefile: Fix installation of ifup-hdlc and init script when
	  using DESTDIR. (Step 2 of cleanup) (closes issue #13430) Reported
	  by: jcollie Patches:
	  0001-Fix-install-of-ifup-hdlc-when-installing-into-an-alt.patch
	  uploaded by jcollie (license 412) Tested by: qwell Note: Patch
	  from #13430 was extended to modify init script installation as
	  well.

	* build_tools/genmodconf (removed), dahdi.rules (removed),
	  build_tools/genudevrules (removed): Remove files that aren't used
	  or are duplicated from dahdi-linux. Step 1 of cleanup.

2008-09-09 18:21 +0000 [r4882-4883]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* Makefile: Fix a few typos

	* dahdi.init: Fix location of fxotune (closes issue #13428)
	  Reported by: eeman

2008-09-04 16:37 +0000 [r4860]  Shaun Ruffell <sruffell@digium.com>

	* Makefile, UPGRADE.txt: * Updates the instructions presented after
	  'make config' about where to set which modules are loaded. *
	  Update UPGRADE.txt to indicate where to set which modules are
	  loaded and where the module parameters are set. Issue# DAHDI-187

2008-09-03 19:38 +0000 [r4859]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* Makefile, README, UPGRADE.txt: Slightly reformat UPDATES.txt for
	  asciidoc . Include it in README.html . See e.g.
	  http://docs.tzafrir.org.il/dahdi-tools/README.html#_upgrade_notes
	  Also fix some links in the README.

2008-08-28 21:40 +0000 [r4853-4855]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* dahdi.init: Simplify reading list of modules from
	  /etc/dahdi/modules .

	* doc, xpp: Ignore generated HTML files.

	* xpp/Makefile: Don't install genzaptelconf: deprecated, and
	  collides with Zaptel.

2008-08-27 17:13 +0000 [r4845-4850]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* modules.sample, dahdi.init: remove some silly echo statement
	  constructions in the init script clean up the modules.sample file
	  to have proper lists of cards supported by each module and remove
	  reference to dahdi_dummy since the init script takes care of
	  loading that module

	* makeopts.in, fxotune.c: actually implement the rest of
	  --enable-dev-mode, and fix up more problems it found

	* Makefile, configure, configure.ac, sethdlc.c, makeopts.in,
	  dahdi_cfg.c: add --enable-dev-mode support, and fix up a couple
	  of warnings found using it (only two, surprisingly)

2008-08-26 14:35 +0000 [r4833-4844]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* Makefile, README, system.conf.sample: * Add a "docs" target to
	  generate documentation. * Demote/promote some headers. * Fix URL
	  for on-line copy of the README.

	* xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Chans.pm: Fix default path of dahdi_cfg
	  (used for probing type of wctdm channels)

2008-08-25 16:12 +0000 [r4826-4827]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* dahdi_cfg.c: Fix more crazy formatting

	* dahdi_cfg.c: Reverse some incorrect logic, and cleanup some very
	  ugly formatting in passing.

2008-08-24 10:53 +0000 [r4821-4822]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* dahdi_cfg.c: We've got a new "zap" string to zap.

	* dahdi_cfg.c: Add support for 56 KB HDLC as well as selectable
	  rate in system.conf

2008-08-20 Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* dahdi-tools version 2.0.0-rc2 released.

2008-08-17 15:50 +0000 [r4787]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	* xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Chans.pm: Dahdi::Chans: fix leftovers from
	  r4767 (handling of spaces) While r4767 solved some parsing
	  problems of channels with "strange" encoding names, it introduced
	  a new problem (e.g.: "RED" after "(In use)" which is fixed here.

2008-08-12 12:59 +0000 [r4764-4767]  Tzafrir Cohen <tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com>

	  of channel signalling types. Use a list of signalling types
	  rather than a regular experssion of a "word".

	* xpp/dahdi_genconf, xpp/genconf_parameters: MFC/R2 configuration
	  generation support If optional setting 'pri_connection_type' is
	  set to R2, configure E1 spans as CAS and generate a unicall.conf
	  snippet (unicall-channels.conf).

	* xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Hardware/PCI.pm, xpp/xpp_fxloader: *
	  xpp_fxloader: shows USB firmware version. * Update PCI IDs
	  database.

	* xpp/lsdahdi, xpp/perl_modules/Dahdi/Chans.pm: Dahdi-perl: Add
	  alarms() method for channels. Use it in lsdahdi. * Better paring
	  of the /proc/dahdi/N channel lines for alarms * Provide it as a
	  separate alarms() method.
